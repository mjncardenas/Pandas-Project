3)	For emergencies, we have each other’s cell phone numbers

Presentation
Topic: Can we predict which airlines will be most likely delayed

1)	What does your group hope to achieve?
•	We would like to predict delays time for flights
•	We are planning to use the datasets to identify which airlines have the most delays. 
•	We also would like to identify what days and months have the most delays. 
•	We would also like to predict delays based on several features

2) Why did you select this topic?
•	We like to travel and improve our travel experience

2)	Description of their source of data
•	We have found the datasets in Kaggle

4) Questions they hope to answer with the data
•	Which airlines have the least/most delays?
•	Are most of the delays correlated with the weather?
•	Which days/months have the most delays?
•	Does departure and destination affect delays?
•	What are/mode causes of the delays?
