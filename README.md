Communication Protocol

1)	We will use zoom at least 2 times a week to discuss what we have accomplished
2)	We will use slack and email to talk to each other on a daily basis or when we have a question.
3)	For emergencies, we have each other’s cell phone numbers. We will call or text one another if we need to contact one another right awat

Presentation
Topic: Can we predict which airports will be most likely delayed and what days/times are they most delayed?

1)	What does your group hope to achieve?
•	We would like to predict delays time for flights 
•   We are planning to use the datasets to identify which airports have the most delays. 
•   We also would like to identify what days and months have the most delays. 
•   We would like to identify which day of the week are airports the busiest
•   We would like to identify if delays occur more in the west coast of the US or east coast of the US.

2) Why did you select this topic?
•	We like to travel and improve our travel experience

2)	Description of their source of data
•	We have found the datasets in Kaggle

4) Questions they hope to answer with the data
•	Which destinations cause the least and most delays for Southwest Airlines?
•	What are the airports with the most delays?
•	Which day of the week has the most delays?
•   Do east coast airports have more delays than west coast airports?

5) Plans
•	Upload csv in Jupyter
•	Merge Csv in Jupyter
•	Clean up data in Jupyter
•	Connect the database to Jupyter notebook
•	Move clean data to Postgres database using Pyspark
•	Use machine learning model
•	We will be using flight date, carrier, destination,  origin and destination to describe the arrival delay

• Use Plotlib:
•	For visualization to answer which airlines have the least/most delays, and which months have the most delays 
•	To compare airlines and their air-time and elapsed time
•	To find taxi-in and taxi-out delays in each airport

• Machine Learning
•	Our machine learning model will answer the question based on what origin airline and destination to predict the arrival delay using carrier, flight date, wheels on and off.
•	Our machine learning model will also predict the delays of the flights
•	Our machine learning model will answer the question which airports have the longest time do airplanes have to wait before letting passengers out
