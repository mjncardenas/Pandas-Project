## Conclusion

### Communication Protocol

​
1)	We will use zoom at least 2 times a week to discuss what we have accomplished
2)	We will use slack and email to talk to each other on a daily basis or when we have a question.
3)	For emergencies, we have each other’s cell phone numbers
​
Presentation
Topic: Can we predict which airlines will be most likely delayed
​
1)	What does your group hope to achieve?
•	We would like to predict delays time for flights
•	We are planning to use the datasets to identify which airlines have the most delays. 
•	We also would like to identify what days and months have the most delays. 
•	We would also like to predict delays based on several features
​
2) Why did you select this topic?
•	We like to travel and improve our travel experience
​
2)	Description of their source of data
•	We have found the datasets in Kaggle
​
4) Questions they hope to answer with the data
•	Which airlines have the least/most delays?
•	Are most of the delays correlated with the weather?
•	Which days/months have the most delays?
•	Does departure and destination affect delays?
•	What are/mode causes of the delays?

5) Segment 1:
•	Upload csv in Jupyter
•	Merge Csv in Jupyter
•	Clean up data in Jupyter
•	Connect the database to Jupyter notebook
•	Move clean data to Postgres database using Pyspark
•	Use machine learning model
•	We will be using flight date, carrier, destination,  origin and destination to describe the 
arrival delay
•	Use Plotlib:
•	For visualization to answer which airlines have the least/most delays, and which months have the most delays 
•	To compare airlines and their air-time and elapsed time
•	To find taxi-in and taxi-out delays in each airport
•	Our machine learning model will answer the question based on what origin airline and 
destination to predict the arrival delay using carrier, flight date, wheels on and off.
•	Our machine learning model will also predict the delays of the flights
•	Our machine learning model will answer the question which airports have the longest time do airplanes have to wait before letting passengers out
